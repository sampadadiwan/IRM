## Overview
This PR introduces a direct association between KPIs and Investor KPI Mappings, enhances KPI RAG status computation, and includes general cleanup and test improvements.

## Motivation
The primary motivation is to improve the accuracy and reliability of KPI RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status calculations by ensuring KPIs are directly linked to their respective `InvestorKpiMapping` records, which hold the latest RAG rules. This change also facilitates better data integrity and future enhancements related to KPI management. Additionally, the PR includes cleanup of old migration files and example test files, and adds `from_email` to certain factories for improved testing capabilities.

## What Changed
*   **Database Schema Update**: The `kpis` table now includes a `investor_kpi_mapping_id` column, establishing a direct foreign key relationship to the `investor_kpi_mappings` table.
*   **KPI RAG Status Enhancement**: The [`features/step_definitions/kpi.rb`](features/step_definitions/kpi.rb) file has been updated to explicitly assign the `investor_kpi_mapping` to a KPI object upon creation and before computing its RAG status. This ensures that the most up-to-date RAG rules from the mapping are used for accurate calculations.
*   **Factory Updates**: The `fund` and `investor_kpi_mapping` factories in [`test/factories.rb`](test/factories.rb) now include a `json_fields` attribute with a `from_email` key, enabling more comprehensive testing scenarios involving email.
*   **Migration File Archiving**: Numerous old database migration files from `db/migrate/` have been moved to `db/migrate/archive/` for better organization and to keep the active migration directory clean.
*   **Test File Cleanup**: Example Playwright test files (`tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.js` and `tests/example.spec.js`) and internal Cursor/Roo configuration/rules files (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc`, `.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc`) have been removed.
*   **Minor Test Improvements**: Small adjustments were made to [`features/step_definitions/fund.rb`](features/step_definitions/fund.rb) for improved test output and assertion robustness.

## Refactoring / Behavior Changes
The core behavior change is how KPI RAG status is determined. Previously, there might have been a reliance on implicit relationships or older data. Now, by explicitly linking `Kpi` to `InvestorKpiMapping` and ensuring the latest mapping is used, the RAG status computation is more robust and accurate, directly reflecting the configured rules. The archiving of migration files is a structural refactoring for maintainability.

## Testing
*   Existing Cucumber tests (specifically in [`features/step_definitions/kpi.rb`](features/step_definitions/kpi.rb)) have been updated to reflect and validate the new KPI-to-mapping association and RAG status computation logic.
*   Factory updates in [`test/factories.rb`](test/factories.rb) support new testing scenarios, particularly for email-related functionalities.
*   The removal of example Playwright tests indicates a cleanup of non-application-specific test assets.

## Impact
*   **Data Integrity**: Improved data integrity for KPI and Investor KPI Mapping relationships.
*   **KPI Accuracy**: More accurate and reliable RAG status calculations for KPIs.
*   **Maintainability**: Cleaner `db/migrate` directory and removal of unused test/config files improve overall project maintainability.
*   **No expected user-facing impact** beyond more accurate KPI reporting.

## Review Focus
*   Verify the correctness of the `investor_kpi_mapping_id` foreign key and index in the `kpis` table.
*   Confirm that the logic for assigning `investor_kpi_mapping` in [`features/step_definitions/kpi.rb`](features/step_definitions/kpi.rb) correctly fetches the intended mapping, especially concerning the "latest rag_rules" aspect.
*   Ensure that the archiving of migration files does not inadvertently affect any deployment or rollback procedures.
*   Review the factory updates to ensure they align with current data generation needs.
