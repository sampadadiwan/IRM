**Overview**: This PR introduces enhancements to dashboard widget management, refines currency display precision, and significantly improves the fund unit transfer service with more detailed tracking and robust testing.

**Motivation**:
- To provide more control over dashboard widget visibility and display options.
- To allow for flexible decimal precision in currency display across the application.
- To enhance the accuracy, traceability, and testability of the fund unit transfer process by introducing detailed JSON fields for tracking original amounts and transfer IDs, and by improving the test setup with comprehensive data imports.

**What Changed**:
- **Dashboard Widgets**:
    - Added a `show_menu` attribute to `DashboardWidget` model, controller parameters, and views (`_form.html.erb`, `_dashboard.html.erb`, `show.html.erb`).
    - The `dashboard_widgets` helper now filters widgets based on the `show_menu` attribute.
    - The dashboard navigation (`_dashboard.html.erb`) now uses `show_menu: true` to display widgets in the menu.
    - The dashboard navigation bar has been styled with `sticky-top bg-white shadow-sm` for better user experience.
- **Currency Display**:
    - The `money_to_currency` and `display` helpers in `currency_helper.rb` now accept a `decimals` parameter for controlling precision.
    - The "Kpis" dashboard widget metadata now includes `decimals: 2` by default.
- **Fund Unit Transfer Service**:
    - Renamed `Transfer ID` to `transfer_id` and `Orig Amount` to `orig_amount` (and similar for other fields) in the `json_fields` for `AccountEntry`, `CapitalRemittance`, and `CapitalRemittancePayment` to standardize naming conventions.
    - Added `orig_id` and `transfer_notes` to the `json_fields` for `CapitalRemittance` and `CapitalRemittancePayment` for better traceability.
    - Modified the calculation logic for transferred amounts in `FundUnitTransferService` to explicitly assign `orig_amount * transfer_ratio` instead of using `*=`, ensuring clarity and preventing potential floating-point issues.
    - Updated the `reason` field for `CommitmentAdjustment` to include `transfer_ratio` and `transfer_id`.
- **KPI Display**:
    - Introduced a `decimals` parameter in `display_kpi` helper.
    - Adjusted the display of negative KPI values in `_grid_view_simple_table.html.erb` to remove redundant parentheses.
- **Testing**:
    - The `Transfer Fund Units` scenario in `fund_unit.feature` has been refactored to use `import file` steps for setting up test data, making the tests more robust and easier to manage.
    - Updated step definitions in `fund.rb` to align with the new `json_fields` keys and to perform more precise assertions on transferred amounts and ratios.

**Refactoring / Behavior Changes**:
- The `FundUnitTransferService` now uses more explicit and standardized keys in `json_fields` for tracking transfer-related data, which is a significant architectural shift for data traceability.
- The `CommitmentAdjustment` now includes `transfer_ratio` and `transfer_id` in its reason, providing more context for adjustments.
- The currency display now supports configurable decimal precision, offering more flexibility.
- The dashboard navigation now sticks to the top, improving user experience.

**Testing**:
- Comprehensive Cucumber tests have been updated and expanded for the fund unit transfer functionality, utilizing imported data for a more realistic test environment.
- Assertions in `fund.rb` have been refined to verify the correct transfer of account entries, remittances, distributions, and adjustments, including checks against the new `json_fields` and calculated ratios.

**Impact**:
- **User Interface**: Improved dashboard navigation and more precise currency display.
- **Data Integrity**: Enhanced traceability of fund unit transfers through detailed JSON fields.
- **Testability**: More robust and maintainable tests for fund-related features.
- **Compatibility**: No known backward compatibility issues.

**Review Focus**:
- Review the changes in `FundUnitTransferService` for the correct handling of `json_fields` and the calculation logic for transferred amounts, especially the explicit assignments.
- Verify the new `show_menu` functionality for dashboard widgets and its impact on UI.
- Examine the `decimals` parameter implementation in `currency_helper.rb` and `kpis_helper.rb` to ensure correct precision handling.
- Pay close attention to the updated Cucumber tests in `fund.rb` to ensure all assertions accurately reflect the intended behavior of the fund unit transfer.
