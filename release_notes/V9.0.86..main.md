Overview: This PR introduces comprehensive documentation for e-signing processes and Wati setup, enhances email `from_email` customization, and significantly refactors the KPI module for improved data handling, display, and RAG status calculation. It also refines fund name uniqueness validation.

Motivation:
*   To provide clear and detailed documentation for e-signing workflows (Digio and Docusign) and Wati notification integration, aiding in onboarding and troubleshooting.
*   To allow greater flexibility in email `from_email` addresses for various notifications, enabling funds and investment opportunities to specify their preferred sending email.
*   To improve the accuracy and usability of the KPI module by better integrating `InvestorKpiMapping` for RAG status, common size calculations, and performance table views.
*   To ensure correct uniqueness validation for fund names, excluding snapshot funds.

What Changed:
*   **Documentation**:
    *   Added [`app/packs/core/documents/Esigning Process.md`](app/packs/core/documents/Esigning Process.md) detailing Digio and Docusign e-signing flows, including sending, fetching updates, webhooks, cancellation, and exception cases.
    *   Added [`app/packs/core/notifications/Wati Setup.md`](app/packs/core/notifications/Wati Setup.md) outlining the prerequisites and step-by-step process for setting up Wati for notifications.
*   **Email Customization**:
    *   Modified [`app/packs/core/base/mailers/application_mailer.rb`](app/packs/core/base/mailers/application_mailer.rb) to allow `from_email` to be passed as a parameter, falling back to entity-based `from_email` if not provided.
    *   Updated `DocumentNotifier`, `CapitalDistributionPaymentNotifier`, `CapitalRemittanceNotifier`, `CapitalRemittancePaymentNotifier`, `ExpressionOfInterestNotifier`, and `InvestmentOpportunityNotifier` to include `fund_id` and/or `from_email` in their `email_data` for enhanced customization.
*   **KPI Module Enhancements**:
    *   **Models**:
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/models/kpi.rb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/models/kpi.rb): Updated `Kpi` model to include `investor_kpi_mapping` association, refined `set_rag_status_from_ratio` logic with improved logging and handling of division by zero, and adjusted `ransackable_associations`.
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/models/kpi_report.rb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/models/kpi_report.rb): Modified `compute_common_size_kpi` to find common size KPI using `investor_kpi_mapping_id`.
    *   **Services**:
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/services/import_kpi.rb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/services/import_kpi.rb) and [`app/packs/startups/kpis/services/kpi_workbook_reader.rb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/services/kpi_workbook_reader.rb): Ensured `investor_kpi_mapping` is associated with `Kpi` objects during import and workbook reading.
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/services/performance_table_service.rb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/services/performance_table_service.rb): Added `investor_kpi_mapping` to `MetricRow` and updated `build_row` to pass this mapping, enabling better display logic.
    *   **Views**:
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/investor_kpi_mappings/_investor_kpi_mapping.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/investor_kpi_mappings/_investor_kpi_mapping.html.erb) and [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/investor_kpi_mappings/index.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/investor_kpi_mappings/index.html.erb): Added display for `base_for_common_size` (Common Size) in investor KPI mappings.
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/_filter.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/_filter.html.erb): Added "Common" as a unit option in KPI report filters.
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/_grid_view_simple_table.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/_grid_view_simple_table.html.erb) and [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/performance_table.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpi_reports/performance_table.html.erb): Adjusted table structure and added `row-toggle` Stimulus controller for improved nested KPI display in grid and performance tables.
        *   [`app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpis/show.html.erb`](app/packs/startups/kpis/views/kpis/show.html.erb): Added display for `Common Size Value` and `Investor Kpi Mapping` on the KPI show page.
*   **Fund Validation**:
    *   [`app/packs/funds/funds/models/fund.rb`](app/packs/funds/funds/models/fund.rb): Replaced `validates :name, uniqueness: { scope: :entity_id }, if: -> { !snapshot? }` with a custom validation `name_must_be_unique_for_non_snapshots` to ensure fund names are unique only for non-snapshot funds within the same entity.
*   **Minor UI/Formatting**:
    *   [`app/packs/core/investors/views/investors/_show.html.erb`](app/packs/core/investors/views/investors/_show.html.erb): Moved "Investee Entity" display into the debug block and minor formatting adjustments.

Refactoring / Behavior Changes:
*   The `from_email` logic in `ApplicationMailer` now prioritizes a `params[:from_email]` if provided, allowing for more dynamic sender email addresses.
*   KPI RAG status calculation is now more robust with explicit logging and handling of zero values in tagged KPIs.
*   The KPI import and workbook reading processes now correctly associate `InvestorKpiMapping` with `Kpi` records, which is crucial for accurate RAG status and common size calculations.
*   The fund name uniqueness validation is now more precise, preventing conflicts only for active, non-snapshot funds.

Testing:
*   Updated Cucumber step definitions in [`features/step_definitions/fund.rb`](features/step_definitions/fund.rb) and [`features/step_definitions/kpi.rb`](features/step_definitions/kpi.rb) to reflect changes in email subject checking, investor KYC visibility, and KPI RAG status computation, ensuring existing functionalities are not regressed and new behaviors are covered.

Impact:
*   Improved clarity and self-service capabilities for e-signing and Wati setup.
*   Enhanced flexibility for email notifications.
*   More accurate and user-friendly KPI reporting and analysis.
*   Corrected data integrity for fund names.

Review Focus:
*   The new `from_email` logic in `ApplicationMailer` and its propagation to various notifiers.
*   The changes in KPI model associations and the `set_rag_status_from_ratio` method, especially the handling of `investor_kpi_mapping` and division by zero.
*   The new `name_must_be_unique_for_non_snapshots` validation in the `Fund` model.
*   The UI changes in KPI reports (`_grid_view_simple_table.html.erb`, `performance_table.html.erb`) and their interaction with the `row-toggle` Stimulus controller.
