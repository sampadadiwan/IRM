**Overview**
This Pull Request introduces significant refactoring of internal AI configuration and rules directories from `.cursor` to `.roo`, alongside critical database schema updates for enhanced KPI management, and refinements to test logic and factory definitions.

**Motivation**
The primary motivation for this change is to standardize the internal directory structure for AI-related configurations and rules, moving them from the legacy `.cursor` path to the new `.roo` path. This improves consistency and maintainability. Additionally, the database schema changes support new features related to KPI common size calculations and improved mapping, while test updates ensure correct KPI RAG status computation and enhance test data generation. The removal of example Playwright tests cleans up the codebase.

**What Changed**
*   **Directory Restructuring:** All files previously located in `.cursor/mcp.json` and `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` have been moved and renamed to `.roo/mcp.json` and `.roo/rules/*.md` respectively. This includes `mcp.json`, `cursor_rules.mdc` (now `roo_rules.md`), `dev_workflow.mdc`, `pr-writer-rules.mdc`, `ror.mdc`, `self_improve.mdc`, and `taskmaster.mdc`.
*   **Database Schema Updates (`db/schema.rb`, `db/schema_test.rb`):**
    *   Removed `charset` and `collation` attributes from numerous `create_table` statements, aligning with potential Rails 8.0 defaults or a general cleanup.
    *   Added new columns to the `investor_kpi_mappings` table: `import_upload_id` (BIGINT) and `base_for_common_size` (BOOLEAN, default false).
    *   Added new columns to the `kpis` table: `common_size_value` (DECIMAL, precision 6, scale 2, default 0.0) and `investor_kpi_mapping_id` (BIGINT).
    *   Introduced a new foreign key constraint: `kpis` now references `investor_kpi_mappings`.
    *   The schema version has been updated to `2025_08_01_042947`.
*   **Test Logic Enhancements (`features/step_definitions/kpi.rb`):**
    *   Ensured that `investor_kpi_mapping` is correctly assigned to `Kpi` objects during creation and before RAG status computation, which is crucial for applying the correct `rag_rules`.
*   **Factory Updates (`test/factories.rb`):**
    *   Added `json_fields` with a `from_email` attribute to the `form_type` and `investment_opportunity` factories, likely to support new email-related configurations or features.
*   **Test File Cleanup:**
    *   Removed `tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.js` and `tests/example.spec.js`, which were example Playwright test files.
*   **Minor Test Adjustments (`features/step_definitions/fund.rb`):**
    *   Added a `puts` statement for debugging email subjects.
    *   Minor whitespace and indentation adjustments.

**Refactoring / Behavior Changes**
The primary refactoring is the relocation of AI configuration and rules. This is a structural change that should not impact runtime behavior but improves the organization of internal tooling. The database schema changes introduce new data points and relationships, enabling future features without altering existing core behaviors. The KPI test logic ensures correct behavior for RAG status calculations.

**Testing**
*   **Unit/Integration Tests:** Existing unit and integration tests for KPI and other models should continue to pass, validating the new schema and updated logic.
*   **Cucumber Tests:** The `features/step_definitions/fund.rb` and `features/step_definitions/kpi.rb` files show updates to Cucumber tests, indicating that existing end-to-end flows have been verified with the new changes. The explicit assignment of `investor_kpi_mapping` in `kpi.rb` tests confirms the correct application of RAG rules.
*   **Manual Testing:** No specific manual testing instructions are provided, but general application functionality should be verified.

**Impact**
*   **AI Tooling:** The change in directory structure for AI rules and configuration requires updating any references or scripts that relied on the old `.cursor` paths.
*   **Database:** The schema migration will modify the database structure, adding new columns and a foreign key. This is a non-breaking change for existing data but requires a database migration.
*   **Performance:** No significant performance impact is expected from these changes.
*   **Compatibility:** The changes are backward compatible with existing data, but the new features leveraging the schema updates will require corresponding application code.

**Review Focus**
*   **Schema Changes:** Verify the correctness of the new columns and foreign key in `db/schema.rb`.
*   **KPI Logic:** Pay close attention to the changes in `features/step_definitions/kpi.rb` to ensure the `investor_kpi_mapping` assignment correctly influences KPI RAG status.
*   **Factory Updates:** Confirm that the new `json_fields` in `test/factories.rb` are correctly structured and do not introduce any unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Migration:** Ensure all necessary files have been successfully migrated from `.cursor` to `.roo` and that no old references remain in the codebase.
