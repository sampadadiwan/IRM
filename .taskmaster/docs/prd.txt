Product Requirements Document: Capital Remittance Step Refactoring

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the `features/step_definitions/fund.rb` file by extracting all steps related to "capital_remittance" into a new, dedicated step definition file. This will improve code organization, maintainability, and readability.

## 2. Goals
- Improve code organization by separating concerns.
- Enhance maintainability by isolating capital remittance-related steps.
- Facilitate easier testing and debugging of capital remittance functionalities.

## 3. Scope
The scope of this refactoring includes:
- Identifying all Cucumber step definitions related to "capital_remittance" within `features/step_definitions/fund.rb`.
- Creating a new file, `features/step_definitions/capital_remittance.rb`, to house these steps.
- Moving the identified steps from `fund.rb` to `capital_remittance.rb`.
- Verifying that the moved steps function correctly.
- Deleting the moved steps from `fund.rb`.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Identify Capital Remittance Steps
- The system shall identify all Cucumber step definitions in `features/step_definitions/fund.rb` that are related to capital remittance. This includes steps that interact with capital remittance features, forms, or data.

### 4.2 Create New Step Definition File
- The system shall create a new file named `features/step_definitions/capital_remittance.rb`.

### 4.3 Move Steps
- The system shall move the identified capital remittance step definitions from `features/step_definitions/fund.rb` to `features/step_definitions/capital_remittance.rb`.
- The moved steps must retain their original functionality and context.

### 4.4 Confirm Functionality
- The system shall confirm that the moved steps in `features/step_definitions/capital_remittance.rb` are correctly recognized and executed by the Cucumber test suite. This involves running relevant tests that utilize these steps.

### 4.5 Delete Original Steps
- Upon successful confirmation of functionality, the system shall delete the capital remittance step definitions from `features/step_definitions/fund.rb`.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Maintainability:** The new file structure should be easy to understand and maintain.
- **Testability:** The refactored code should remain fully testable.
- **Performance:** The refactoring should not negatively impact test execution performance.

## 6. Tasks to be generated by Taskmaster AI:
1.  **Identify Capital Remittance Steps in fund.rb**: Analyze `features/step_definitions/fund.rb` to list all step definitions related to capital remittance.
2.  **Create capital_remittance.rb file**: Create a new file `features/step_definitions/capital_remittance.rb`.
3.  **Move Capital Remittance Steps**: Transfer identified steps from `fund.rb` to `capital_remittance.rb`.
4.  **Verify Moved Steps Functionality**: Run relevant Cucumber tests to ensure steps in `capital_remittance.rb` work correctly.
5.  **Delete Capital Remittance Steps from fund.rb**: Remove the moved steps from `features/step_definitions/fund.rb`.
