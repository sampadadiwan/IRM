  # 12. AllocateMasterFundAccountEntries Operation
  ############################################################
  # The AllocateMasterFundAccountEntries class is responsible for allocating master fund account entries
  # based on exchange rates and fund formulas. It inherits from AllocationBaseOperation and defines two
  # main steps: get_exchange_rate and allocate_master_fund_account_entries.
  #
  # Steps:
  # 1. get_exchange_rate: Retrieves the exchange rate between the master fund's currency and the fund's currency.
  #    If no exchange rate is found, it logs an error and raises an exception.
  # 2. allocate_master_fund_account_entries: Allocates account entries for the master fund based on the provided
  #    fund formula, start and end dates, and other parameters. It generates account entries to allocate to the
  #    commitments of the feeder fund and handles any errors that occur during the allocation process.
  #
  # Methods:
  # - get_exchange_rate: Retrieves the exchange rate for the given fund.
  # - allocate_master_fund_account_entries: Allocates master fund account entries based on the fund formula and
  #   other parameters.
  # - generate_account_entry_to_allocate: Generates an account entry to allocate to the commitments of the feeder fund.
