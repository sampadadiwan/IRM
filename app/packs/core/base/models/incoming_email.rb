# SendGrid (login using support@caphive.com) is used to route incoming emails to our app
# We have setup godaddy domain to route emails to SendGrid
# email@local.caphive.app, email@dev.caphive.app and email@prod.caphive.app are all routed to SendGrid
# SendGrid then forwards the email to our app with the original email address as the recipient
# 2 Use cases:
# 1. We parse the email address to get the owner_id and owner_type - this use case is to attach incoming emails to the owner Example: deal.1@prod.caphive.app or individual_kyc.23@prod.caphive.app
# 2. We also get incoming emails from potential portfolio companies with the investor presentation to the fund
