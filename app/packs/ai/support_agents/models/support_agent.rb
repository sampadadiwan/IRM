class SupportAgent < ApplicationRecord
  # SupportAgent represents an AI-driven entity responsible for
  # validating consistency between structured fields on a model
  # and extracted values from uploaded documents. It leverages LLMs
  # (Large Language Models) to parse and extract content for verification.
  #
  # Includes:
  #   - WithCustomField: adds support for attaching custom metadata/fields
  #   - WithFolder: provides organization of agents into folders
  #
  # Validations enforce constraints on agent identity and type to ensure
  # consistent naming and classification.
